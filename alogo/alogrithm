1. Declare three variables: sentenceLength and set it to 0, wordCount and set it to 1 (assuming the sentence has at least one word), and vowelCount and set it to 0.
2. Create a loop that iterates through each character of the sentence.
3. Inside the loop:
   - Increment sentenceLength by 1 for each character.
   - Check if the character is a space. If it is, increment wordCount by 1.
   - Check if the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u). If it is, increment vowelCount by 1.
4. Once the loop finishes, print out the following results:
   - The total number of characters in the sentence stored in sentenceLength.
   - The total number of words in the sentence stored in wordCount.
   - The total number of vowels in the sentence stored in vowelCount.

This algorithm accurately calculates the length of the sentence, the number of words, and the number of vowels in the sentence.
